They both Function as an Analogy to our Tensional Cognition that takes place in the Right hemisphere of our Brain.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Right Hand</strong> is our Pedagogic Terminal, or Gamepad for Measuring a Humane and therefore Sensible Experience, which is Liberated from Pain and Sorrow.</p>\n<p>A <strong>Liberated</strong> and therefore Healthy <strong>Experience of the Past</strong>, carries Efficiently the following qualities:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Infinity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Intensity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Density</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Resistance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.

No matter how we name it, it is Sensed as:</p>\n<p>1. Potential Energy</p>\n<p>2. Capacitance</p>\n<p>3. Probability</p>\n<p>4. Selfhood</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*xWZfpwCHuK9TAquRagvN4w.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Identified Intensity</strong> is the Potential appearance of:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Kinetic Energy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Radiant Energy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Thermal Energy</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Chemical Energy</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*i4ISch-rQRCkmRduriBjQA.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Density</strong> is the awareness of Multiple Intensities grouped together.

It declares an Area of Probabilities based on Sensible Behaviors. Probability for Resistance exists under the following Conditions:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Correlation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Curvature</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Clustering</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.

That happens because all these Measures are at the same time Non-Existent, and Coexistent since they are built upon a Series of Principles solely sensed though Analogy, Symbolism, or Trust to secondary References.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*4zHNn2zuDansEacWsBi_gg.png\"></p>\n<p>Our Feet touch, turn, hold and spread across the Substratum of our Experience, but they donâ€™t See, Hear, nor Taste. So, their Awareness lacks such kind of Identified Stimuli. Still they are capable to Experience Movement through Touch.</p>\n<p>The <strong>Right Foot</strong> is the Terminal which is associated with <strong>Lower forms of Tensional Intelligence</strong>. In that manner, it signifies a Conditioned Humane Experience; one which Lacks the above Qualities that the Liberated Experience carries.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*F83Lcl3bmsvAvZGJPYaixw.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*meVEanVFL3IVlCrCV9UOgQ.png\"></p>\n<p>As such, a <strong>Non-Humane</strong> and therefore <strong>Conditioned Experience</strong> can be Measured as the Sense of:</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>No-Infinity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>No-Intensity</strong></p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>No-Density</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>No-Resistance</strong></p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> <strong>No-Conductivity</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/906/1*zZspVleBq8RqyvI_asHYiw.png\"></p>\n<p>Pain and Joy are both Interconnected parts of a Sensible Experience, and carry Efficiently One Source of Intelligence.</p>\n<p><strong>To get Liberated from Pain and Sorrow, the Focus should stay on the Higher forms of Intelligence.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The Self is not merely a Principle of the Conditioned Experience, and Selfhood is not the actual Self.</em></p>"}
