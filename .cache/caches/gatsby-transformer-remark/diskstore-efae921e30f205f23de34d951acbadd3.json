The <strong>Absence of Capacity</strong> leads to Attachment; a Purposeless kind of Intention which lacks Courage and shows No-Ethical Conduct whatsoever.</p>\n<p>2. <strong>No-Truth</strong> declares an Intention without Ethical Effort. A Behavior of Dishonesty, which derives from the Attachment towards attitudes of No-Receptiveness.</p>\n<p>3. <strong>No-Coverage</strong> means No-Imagination, and it leads to the Lack of Generosity. That kind of Non-Altruistic attitude direct us towards Behaviors of Unethical Resolve.</p>\n<p>4. When there is <strong>No good grasp of Formations</strong>, a Misleading sense of No-Fallacy arises; one which is based on Non-Inclusion, Non-Truthfulness and it turns to become an Unethical View.</p>\n<p><em>An <strong>Unethical Livelihood</strong> is one with No-Wisdom and No-Love. It is a life which forms No-Memories worth of Preservation.</em></p>"}
