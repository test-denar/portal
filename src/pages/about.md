        title: A. Self-Description
        subtitle: Ecosphere & meta-aesthetics
        content: >+
          Humane and therefore Sensible Standards are the Qualities of our Human
          and Practical Design Features.


          These meta-Aesthetic Measures, which are not based on opinions,
          strategies, or other self-invented choices that we make, define the
          Description of our Ecosphere.


          Sensible Ecosphere (from Greek οἶκος oîkos "environment", and σφαῖρα
          "sphere"), also known as Biosphere is the worldwide Sum of all
          Sentient Life, and therefore it is Sensible by Design.


          The Sensibility of the Ecosphere is a quality which can be described
          as its Source, but also its resulting Resources, Services, Networks
          and Identity. What is called as the Nature of our Ecosphere, and
          therefore of ourselves is its States of Sensibility and their
          Phenomena. Therefore, to be Sensible and have a meaningfully
          fulfilling life, we ought to understand first that this Ecosphere is
          our Self-Description.

        subtitle: Ecophysiology & meta-governance
        content: >-
          To master and completely understand the dynamics of the Self and
          therefore of Life, we must employ what is already designed as a
          mechanism for measurement by nature. Self-Adaptation is a Natural form
          of meta-governance which acts over all other forms of governance.


          The Humane Standards are founded on our Ecophysiological Human
          factors. Ecophysiology is the Nature of the Dynamics of our inner and
          outer Environment. These are the physiological and psychological
          principles that drive Ethical and therefore Humane Science and Design
          forward.

        subtitle: Ecocentrism & meta-interfaces
        content: >-
          It is time for all people to aknowledge that Human-Centered means
          Eco-Centered, and to Respect all Nature as our own meta-interface.


          Through Self-Concensus, which is the Belief in our own Truth as the
          ultimate form of Reality, we have the power to Define our Future, by
          Being a Past which is Fully Present.


          With our Concent, we master the art of Self-Governance, which is the
          Source of all other forms of Management. This is only Possible because
          of the Design of our own body, and not the fascinations of our
          Intellect.
