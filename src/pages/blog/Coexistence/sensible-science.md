> The Iterative and Persistent Inquiry into the True Nature of what we care most about is what constitutes Science. Sensible Science is the Ethical Practice of Research that is Sensitive to the Sensitivity of Life itself.

* The Intuitive Processing One Source of **Indefinite Capacity** — the so-called Self — drives Sensible and therefore Humane Science forward.
* That Self, appears upon the Infinite Cosmic Resources of **Intense Magnitudes** as the Logic between their Tensions.
* That Behavior acts as a Service for the Self’s Interface, and Sustains a Sense of **Dense Coverage**.
* Density, becomes a Social matter between **Resistant Formations** of Relational Networks.
* Through Multiplication and Reproduction, they become **Conductive Conversions** of Identified and Independent Identities of the Self.

One’s Self acquires Logic over the aforementioned Properties of itself and attains the abilities of:

1\. **Conscience**: Intuitive Stasis

(Statistical Significance, Sample Space)

2\. **Observation**: Tensional Thesis

(Probability Function, Null Hypothesis = TRUE)

3\. **Balance**: Behavioral Synthesis

(Probability Density, Event Space)

4\. **Position**: Relational Hypothesis

(Probability Clustering, Null Hypothesis = FALSE)

5\. **Adaptability**: Emotional Systasis

(Statistical Significance, Probabilistic Causation)

> **Through Sensible Science we actually map only One Source of Intelligence, which becomes Potent as it expands into these kinds of Humane Measures.**

* **Conscience** is an **Intuitive** form of **Stasis** which is operated by the **Cephalic Region**.
* **Observation** is a Conscious **Thesis** surrounding the appearance of **Tensions**, and its center is the **Cervical Region (Neck).**
* **Balance** is a **Behavior** of **Synthesis** which is established through the **Thoracic Region**.
* **Position** is a **Relational** form of **Hypothesis**, and it is driven through our **Dorsal Region (Back).**
* Different Positions give us the advantage to achieve **Adaptability**. That Quality of Conscience is what gives birth to our **Emotions** surrounding what remains as the **Systasis** of this cosmos. Emotional Adaptability through the processing of what comes through us is also what makes us Humans, and has its center in the **Abdomen Region**.

### Wholesome Intention

As the Humane Standards can be Established through their 3 respective Measures:

1\. **Experience** (Recollection/ Being/Character/Neutrons)

2\. **Attention** (Involvement /Sensing/Intelligence/Electrons)

3\. **Intention** (Desire/ Thinking/Community/Protons)

***

**Through Wholesome Intentions for Attentive Experiences, may we all enjoy:**

1\. **Limitless Love.** May all beings have happiness and its causes.

2\. **Limitless Compassion**. May all beings be free from suffering and its causes.

3\. **Limitless Joy.** May all beings never be separated from the great happiness that is beyond all misery.

4\. **Limitless Equanimity.** May all beings dwell in Equanimity, unaffected by attraction to dear ones and aversion to others.

5\. **Limitless Health.** May all beings recover from the sicknesses of Mind and Body pollution and enjoy relative and absolute health, now and forever.

6\. **Limitless Ecological Regeneration.** May all beings relax in a pure and healthy outer and inner environment, now and forever.

7\. **Limitless Peace.** May all beings enjoy inner and world Peace, now and forever.
