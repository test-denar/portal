> To live a Happy and Fulfilling Life, we first have to address our Issues surrounding the Distribution, and Source of Value. No matter what kind of Resources we Process throughout our lives — so to find out what is Valuable to us — and our Beliefs concerning the Scales of these Values, **they all are of One Source**.

Time and Words tend to Confuse us, because they divide our Experience in Countless Phenomena. The Truth is that there is only One Source of Experience, and like a Source of Water, it always tends to flow along the Paths of its Roots. The same way that a river is guided by the Steps of its Ancestors who formed the land and allowed it to be born — be itself.

**All Phenomenologies — which are practically all forms of Human Culture, either Scientific, Artistic, or Religious are of One Source.** That Practically means that despite our Systems and Beliefs — One Source is the most Ancient Ancestor of Everything in this Cosmos. It’s Flow and Character became our own Nature of Existence, and as it Flows now through us, it defines our Path.

> That Nature, which can be approached as a Statistical Significance by Science, as Inspiration by Arts, and as God by Religions is our Character’s Lifelong Teacher.

_The Humane Standards approach that Nature as a Lifelong Practice of Self-Governance. Therefore, to Govern — we Empower each Individual on their Path towards Humane Behaviors. **Humane are the Sensible Behaviors which are Natural and at the same time Attentive to the fact that we are all here to Coexist with each other — and within this Garden of ours — Earth.**_

### Bio-Certified Deployment

> The same way that the Natural Seasons Sustain an Order within an Ever-Changing Environment, we ought to organize our Efforts and Deployment.

Although we propose a Standard Annual Planning which is presented below, you can further adjust the first month to a different one which seems more Practical for you. That being said, the following 6 Operations can’t change their Order of Progression.

**The Sensible Seasons progress Annually in the proceeding Cyclical and Algorithmic Sequence:**

1. **JUNE — JULY: Empowerment of Genesis**
2. **AUGUST — SEPTEMBER: Empowerment of Mimesis**
3. **OCTOBER — NOVEMBER: Support of Practice**
4. **DECEMBER — JANUARY: Support of Investigation**
5. **FEBRUARY — MARCH: Coexistent Growth**
6. **APRIL — MAY: Coexistent Inheritance**

_Here we can witness 3 Recurrent Phases — that one of Empowerment, one for Support and one for Coexistence. Each of them, are further divided into 2 Operations._

### A Reference to the Ecological Seasons

A Year is a Complete Ritual on its own, and therefore we can learn a lot through Reflection on the Changes which Characterize each Season. This Protocol Measures Six Seasons. This is an ancient approach which is still used today by Ecologists across the world. The so-called Ecological Seasons are distinguished from the meteorological and astronomical seasons, and usually they do not have fixed calendar-based dates.

#### **The 6 Ecological Seasons are:**

1. **Summer Opening — Estival**:

Begins June in most temperate climates. Trees are in full leaf. Birds hatch and raise offspring.

2\. **Summer Closing — Serotinal**:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/679/1*vToPGixCvS2bpE2z_2Xubw.png)

Generally, begins mid to late August. Deciduous leaves begin to change color in higher latitude locations (above 45 north). Young birds reach maturity and join other adult birds preparing for autumn migration. The traditional “harvest season” begins by early September.

3\. **Autumn — Autumnal**:

Generally, begins mid to late September. Tree leaves are in full color, and then turn brown and fall to the ground. Birds migrate back to wintering areas.

4\. **Winter — Hibernal**:

Begins December (mild temperate), November (cool temperate). Deciduous trees are bare and fallen leaves begin to decay. Migrating birds settled in winter habitats.

5\. **Spring Opening — Prevernal**:

Begins February (mild temperate), to March (cool temperate). Deciduous tree buds begin to swell. Some types of migrating birds fly from winter to summer habitats.

6\. **Spring Closing — Vernal**:
