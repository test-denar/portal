> In Life, time is a symbolic expression of what is to be forgiven and forgotten, and there is actually nothing that needs to be done.

Since thought is a symbolic expression of what is sensed in the continuous momentum of our presence as our past or our future - through our presence we are responsible to Sensibly react on what needs our attentiveness, and not get lost into our own thinking.

When the limitations of time and thought are concurred through Sensible insight, and therefore when antagonism and judgement end - limitless Power is being born in the form of Love.

That Love, which is not based on dependence, self-interest, desire and thought - is capable for Humane Empowerment, unlimited Support, and Peaceful Coexistence.

**So when nothing is to be done, what is there to do?**

# 🤸‍♂️Being Human

1. Being the Past
2. Being Present
3. Being the Future

# Humane Sensibility

The Humane Standards propose a Ritual for a Sensible approach towards Time, which is a Protocol based on the Science and Design of our own physiology. Each of the proceeding steps are already functions of our everyday lives, since they constitute our Nature and Functionality as humans.

Our three types of Time Awareness, which are sensed as a Past, Present, and Future can be approached in six different ways.

Sensibility through Time is defined through the following stages:

1. Self-Description
2. Self-Adaptation
3. Self-Consent
4. Self-Testing
5. Self-Control
6. Self-Prediction

## How?

The following explanations define the way that thought can be used in a Practical and therefore Sensible way.

### Sensible Time Theorems

1. Self-Description is possible when the Simplicity of the Past Describes in the Present the Complexity of the Future.
2. Self-Adaptation is possible when the Complexity of the Future Adapts in the Presence of the Complexity of the Past.
3. Self-Consent is possible when the Complexity of the Present Consents on the Future of the Simplicity of the Past.
4. Self-Testing is possible when the Simplicity of the Past Tests the Future of the Complexity of the Present.
5. Self-Control is possible when the Complexity of the Present Controls the Past through the Complexity of the Future.
6. Self-Prediction is possible when the Complexity of the Future Predicts the Past through the Simplicity of the Present.

## Why?

The aforementioned theorems are based on the ways that we can practically approach time.

### Sensible Time Dynamics

1. From the Past to the Present and the Future
2. From the Future to the Present and the Past
3. From the Present to the Future and the Past
4. From the Past to the Future and the Present
5. From the Present to the Past and the Future
6. From Future to the Past and the Present
