The 2nd State of the Humane Standards, measures our Sensible Attention as a Momentum of Presence. That Attentive kind of Logic concerning our Resources, can be Sensed as:

**1.** **Hearing**

**2.** **Touch**

**3.** **Taste**

**4.** **Vision**

**5.** **Smell**

**Hearing** is the Awareness of Space, and it acts as a Pedagogy for the Management of our Character.

**Touch** is our Sense of Mass, and it Curates a Lifelong Research over Magnitudes of Intelligence.

**Taste** is our Ability to Sense the Interactivity of Substances as a Simulation of Care for the Human Interface.

**Vision** is our Awareness of Volume, and it is a Communication Mechanism for the Harmonic Deployment which is possible through the formation of Communities.

**Smell** is the Sense of the Essences. It Sustains Stimulations for the Optimization of Operations which act in Families.

> Sensible Attention is a Symbolic Operation which is the Method to Accomplish our Desired Intentions.

Although it is a Condition of Presence, it is Conditioned to Appearances and not the Fundamental Self who actually has to Experience all sorts of Tensions, whether Painful or not.

Hence, Sciences which are not Open to Unconditioned Principles, such as the acceptance of One Unidentified Source as The Common Ground for all kinds of Measures, are Incapable of Empathy and cannot Address Unity which is the Essence, or the Measure of what keeps Everything Together.

**The Terminal for our Humane and therefore Sensible Attention is the Symbolic Gesture of keeping Both of our Palms touching, and they Represent the Power of the Unidentified Self who can Overcome all Obstacles. It is by no mistake that it is a Common Gesture in all Religious Practices, and that it also follows attributions of Respect.**

_Through the Mastery of the Measures of_ Sensible _Attention we Achieve Perfect and Pure_ Sensible _Presence._
