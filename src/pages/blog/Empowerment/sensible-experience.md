> Three Distinguished States of Existence, take on the form of what we Observe as the Past, Present, and Future.

**The 1st State constitutes Sensible Experience; a Passive form of Observation surrounding the Potential Value of the Static in Time Past.**

The Terminals of the human body which the Humane Standards use as a Pedagogic Reference to the Analysis of the Past are the Right hand and foot. They both Function as an Analogy to our Tensional Cognition that takes place in the Right hemisphere of our Brain.

The **Right Hand** is our Pedagogic Terminal, or Gamepad for Measuring a Humane and therefore Sensible Experience, which is Liberated from Pain and Sorrow.

A **Liberated** and therefore Healthy **Experience of the Past**, carries Efficiently the following qualities:

**1.** **Infinity**

**2.** **Intensity**

**3.** **Density**

**4.** **Resistance**

**5. Conductivity**

**Infinity** is the Sensible Experience of One Unidentified Source, which grew to become our Cosmic Resources. No matter how we name it, it is Sensed as:

1\. Potential Energy

2\. Capacitance

3\. Probability

4\. Selfhood

**Identified Intensity** is the Potential appearance of:

**1.** **Kinetic Energy**

**2.** **Radiant Energy**

**3.** **Thermal Energy**

**4.** **Chemical Energy**

**Density** is the awareness of Multiple Intensities grouped together. It denotes Periodic appearances of:

**1.** **Charge**

**2.** **Current**

**3.** **Resistivity**

**4.** **Power**

**Resistance** is a more Mature form of Energy which grows in Dendritic (Tree-like) Networks. It declares an Area of Probabilities based on Sensible Behaviors. Probability for Resistance exists under the following Conditions:

**1.** **Correlation**

**2.** **Curvature**

**3.** **Clustering**

**4. Causality**

Through Dendritic Social Networks, which mimic the Anatomy of our Neurons, we Collectively Process the Idea of **Selfhood** as a sense of:

**1.** **Child-hood**

**2.** **Parent-hood**

**3.** **Sibling-hood**

**4.** **Spouse-hood**

When we get Attached to Memories of the above Measures of the Past, we Experience Pain and Sorrow. That happens because all these Measures are at the same time Non-Existent, and Coexistent since they are built upon a Series of Principles solely sensed though Analogy, Symbolism, or Trust to secondary References.

Our Feet touch, turn, hold and spread across the Substratum of our Experience, but they don’t See, Hear, nor Taste. So, their Awareness lacks such kind of Identified Stimuli. Still they are capable to Experience Movement through Touch.

The **Right Foot** is the Terminal which is associated with **Lower forms of Tensional Intelligence**. In that manner, it signifies a Conditioned Humane Experience; one which Lacks the above Qualities that the Liberated Experience carries.

As such, a **Non-Humane** and therefore **Conditioned Experience** can be Measured as the Sense of:

**1.** **No-Infinity**

**2.** **No-Intensity**

**3.** **No-Density**

**4.** **No-Resistance**

**5.** **No-Conductivity**

Pain and Joy are both Interconnected parts of a Sensible Experience, and carry Efficiently One Source of Intelligence.

**To get Liberated from Pain and Sorrow, the Focus should stay on the Higher forms of Intelligence.**

_The Self is not merely a Principle of the Conditioned Experience, and Selfhood is not the actual Self._
