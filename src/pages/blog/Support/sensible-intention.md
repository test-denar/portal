> Sensible Intention is the Experimental Research surrounding the Potential Value of the Future, and its Symbolic Terminals are the Left Hand and Foot.

Our **Left Hand** is associated with the Measures of an **Enlightened Sensible Intention**, and reveals us the **Dynamics of the Future**.

**Enlightenment is the Intensity of an Attentive Experience**, and it denotes **Capacity**; the Value of **Magnitude** which has **Coverage** over **Convertible** **Formations**.

The Logic concerning our Resources expands to the following Five Classifications of Attention:

**1.** **Detachment**

**2.** **Truth**

**3.** **Imagination**

**4.** **Fallacy**

**5.** **Memory**

**Detachment** is the Source of Capacity that gives birth to:

**1.** **Purpose**

**2.** **Courage**

**3.** **Ethical Conduct**

**Truth** is the Magnitude of Resources concerning matters of:

**1.** **Honesty**

**2.** **Receptiveness**

**3.** **Ethical Effort**

**Imagination** is a Service of Coverage over the matters of:

**1.** **Generosity**

**2.** **Altruism**

**3.** **Ethical Resolve**

**Fallacy** is a Form of Verbal Misconception surrounding Social matters of:

**1.** **Inclusion**

**2.** **Truthfulness**

**3.** **Ethical View**

**Memory** is the Convertibility in matters of:

**1.** **Love**

**2.** **Wisdom**

**3.** **Ethical Livelihood**

_Although the Left Hand marks a territory on which our Future becomes Potent through Enlightened Humane, and therefore_ Sensible _Intentions, the Left Foot shows one that preserves attitudes of Attachment to the Future._

**Attachment to Dynamics which are nether Present, nor Past experiences of ours, lead to Non-Humane Intentions which are Painful and Lack the Qualities of the Enlightened Intention.**

**Through Syllogism on the Opposite results which are the byproduct of Non-Humane Intention we come to the following understanding:**

1\. The **Absence of Capacity** leads to Attachment; a Purposeless kind of Intention which lacks Courage and shows No-Ethical Conduct whatsoever.

2\. **No-Truth** declares an Intention without Ethical Effort. A Behavior of Dishonesty, which derives from the Attachment towards attitudes of No-Receptiveness.

3\. **No-Coverage** means No-Imagination, and it leads to the Lack of Generosity. That kind of Non-Altruistic attitude direct us towards Behaviors of Unethical Resolve.

4\. When there is **No good grasp of Formations**, a Misleading sense of No-Fallacy arises; one which is based on Non-Inclusion, Non-Truthfulness and it turns to become an Unethical View.

_An **Unethical Livelihood** is one with No-Wisdom and No-Love. It is a life which forms No-Memories worth of Preservation._
